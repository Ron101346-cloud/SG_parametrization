# WECC SG Governor Fitting

This repository contains scripts to map PSSE synchronous generator data
into Lizhiâ€™s simulation framework. The workflow includes:

- Parsing .raw and .dyr files
- Mapping GENROU and SEXS models directly
- Governor parameter fitting via Bode plot optimization

## Usage
Run the optimization with:
```bash
python bode_plot_fit.py
